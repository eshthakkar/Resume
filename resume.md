## Background

I am an experienced hardware programmer transitioning to software. My 4+ years of programming experience is in C and verilog on large code bases. 

In order to move to software, I have worked on developing my Python, algorithms, cloud computing and javascript skills. Now I am actively looking for internships, apprenticeships, backend/ full stack software developer roles.

Outside of the tech world, I enjoy building projects, reading, listening to music and travelling to new places and gathering experiences.
